# Sonos-Discovery
Uses multicast to discover Sonos devices on the local network and creates Json files with their details. 

This is just a hack together of other bits of code from the sonos npm package.

# Usage

run ```npm run go``` to get the app to run. Once it's got all devices you'll need to cancel the app in the terminal. 

You can then run ```npm run pretty``` to format the json files into something readable.
